 * Interface definition of a {@link QuadTreeNode}.
 * <p/>
 * A {@link QuadTreeNode} represents a node in the QuadTree.
 * It represents a square region of color with sides being length of a
 * power of two. Each {@link QuadTreeNode} contains either four child
 * nodes or a single color represented by an {@code int} when it is a leaf.
 * <p/>
 * Recall from hw0, that a single node is also a tree that is rooted at itself.
